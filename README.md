# Friend-Recommender
Using Map-Reduce to recommend friends to Social Network Users
This project implements a simple “People You Might Know”
social network friendship recommendation algorithm. The key idea is that if two people have
a lot of mutual friends, then the system should recommend that they connect with each other
